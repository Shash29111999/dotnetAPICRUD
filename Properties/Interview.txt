What is .NET Framework? What are its key components?

The .NET Framework is a software development platform developed by Microsoft used to build and run applications on Windows. It provides a large class library (FCL) and a runtime environment (CLR) to execute .NET applications.

Key components:

CLR (Common Language Runtime): Executes code and provides services like memory management, security, and exception handling.

CTS (Common Type System): Defines how data types are declared and used across all .NET languages, ensuring type safety and language interoperability.

CLS (Common Language Specification): A subset of CTS that defines a set of rules that all .NET languages must follow to ensure cross-language integration.

FCL (Framework Class Library): A vast collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types.

Explain Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in .NET.

The four pillars of OOP are:

Encapsulation: Hiding internal details of an object and exposing only what’s necessary (e.g., using private fields with public properties).

Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem (e.g., abstract classes or interfaces).

Inheritance: Reusing code by allowing a class to inherit from another (e.g., class Car : Vehicle).

Polymorphism: Ability to take many forms. Implemented via method overloading (compile-time) and method overriding (run-time).

Classes vs. Objects:

A class is a blueprint (e.g., Car class), whereas an object is an instance of that class (e.g., new Car()).

Value types vs. Reference types:

Value types (e.g., int, struct) store data directly on the stack.

Reference types (e.g., class, array) store references on the stack, with actual data on the heap.

What is memory management in .NET?

Memory in .NET is managed automatically by the CLR using a technique called garbage collection (GC).

Stack: Used for static memory allocation (value types, method calls).

Heap: Used for dynamic memory allocation (reference types).

Garbage Collector (GC): Frees memory occupied by unreachable objects.

Boxing: Converting a value type to a reference type (e.g., object obj = 5;).

Unboxing: Converting a reference type back to a value type (e.g., int i = (int)obj;).

What are assemblies in .NET? What are their types?

An assembly is a compiled code library used for deployment, versioning, and security in .NET. It is the building block of .NET applications.

Types:

Private Assemblies: Used only by a single application.

Shared Assemblies: Can be used by multiple applications; usually registered in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).

Satellite Assemblies: Contain localized resources (e.g., language-specific strings).

Each assembly contains metadata, manifest, IL code, and type information.

What are delegates and events in .NET?

Delegates:

Delegates are type-safe function pointers that hold references to methods with a specific signature.

Syntax: delegate void MyDelegate(string message);

Used for callback methods and event handling.

Events:

Events are built on delegates and are used to provide notifications.

Syntax: public event MyDelegate OnProcessCompleted;

Example use case: In a GUI application, clicking a button triggers a click event tied to a delegate method.

What is LINQ?

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) allows querying collections in a consistent manner using SQL-like syntax in C#.

There are two main syntaxes:

Query syntax: var result = from s in students where s.Age > 18 select s;

Method syntax: var result = students.Where(s => s.Age > 18).ToList();

LINQ works on various data sources like arrays, lists, XML, and databases (via LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework).

What is threading and asynchronous programming in .NET?

Threading:

Allows concurrent execution using System.Threading namespace.

Multithreading improves performance by running tasks in parallel but requires synchronization to avoid race conditions.

Async/Await:

Introduced in .NET 4.5 to simplify asynchronous programming.

async keyword marks a method as asynchronous.

await keyword pauses method execution until a task completes.

Difference:

Multithreading uses physical threads; good for CPU-bound operations.

Async/await uses the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP); better for I/O-bound operations.

Example:
async Task<string> GetDataAsync() {
var data = await httpClient.GetStringAsync("url");
return data;
}
